# Examining-the-Impact-of-Covid-Shutdowns-on-Toronto-Restaurants

## Project Description
> This project examines examine the possible factors that lead to employee attrition and also train different machine learning classifiers to predict who is going to resign, based on the dataset “IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance” loaded from Kaggle. According to our literature reviews, Random Forest (RF) is an effective classifier due to its strength in handling multi-dimensional data, therefore, to verify that and to identify the best algorithm, a deeper into the classification predictive modelling for the attrition issue by further examining 6 popular machine learning models, namely the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Naive Bayes (NB), the Logistic Regression, the Ensemble model, and the RF. By comparing and assessing the prediction accuracy of each model, and also concluded the ensemble model was the best classifier to predict employee attrition since it possesses the highest prediction accuracy overall.
> All data analysis and machine learning process are performed using R and the following packages are used: `tidyverse`, `dummies`, `ggplot2`,`MASS`, `leaps`, `FNN`,`class`, `caret`, `gmodels`, `gridExtra`, `e1071`, `kableExtra`,`bookdown`, `here`.
